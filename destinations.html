			<h1>Lukla</h1>
			<h2>Places to Visit</h2><br>
			<h3>Namche</h3><br>
			<p><b>Namche Bazaar is a village in Solukhumbu District in the Sagarmatha Zone of north-eastern Nepal.</b></p><br>
			<p>It is located within the Khumbu area at 3,440 metres (11,286 ft). From Lukla, most trekking groups will take two days to reach Namche Bazaar, a nice easy pace to help in altitude acclimatization. Distance wise, this segment is doable in one long day (8 to 10 hours) but not advised due to increased risk of altitude sickness.</p><br><br><br>
			<h3>Tengboche</h3><br>
			<p><b>Tengboche is an important Buddhist monastery in the mountains of the Himalayan country.</b></p><br>
			<p>Situated in the Khumbu region of north-east Nepal, the home of the Sherpas, Tengboche monastery is famous because of its spectacular and unique location. It lies on the main route to the Base Camp of Mount Everest and offers clear views of the highest mountain in the world. Tengboche became known to the world after Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzin Norgay Sherpa made the first ascent of Mount Everest in 1953. A lot has changed since those days when Tengboche was remote and inaccessible. Today over 30,000 people come every year to enjoy the beauty of Tengboche and splendor of the mountains.</p><br><br><br>
			<h3>Khumjung</h3><br>
			<p><b>The village of Khumjung is not directly on the main trail to the most popular trekking destinations, but to the devout Tibetan Buddhists in the region it is considered a focal point for their faith and it has been a great beneficiary of the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation.</b></p><br><br>
			<p>It is said that the valley was once a lake but the water broke long ago, and Tibetans moved into the area over 300 years ago. Khumjung sits in a high valley that is a steep hike of over an hour above the shopping mecca of Namche and is at the base of the holy mountain, Khumbila. Khumjung is much more traditional in contrast to the more modern and touristy hub of Namche to the south. Surrounding the valley further are the snowy peaks of Kongde and Thamserku, and the famous Everest View hotel is tucked away discretely around a hill to the south.</p><br><br><br><br>
